#### Variational Autoencoders using Tensorflow

- check the tensorflow_101 folder for getting things started
- rest of the files are based on the blog post: 
    http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/post/149329060653/under-the-hood-of-the-variational-autoencoder-in

The code is similar to the one in the blog post; My goal with this is to go through all the math and get a grasp on the model while using Tensorflow -> For an in-depth understanding, please see my comments.
